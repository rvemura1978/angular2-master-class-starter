# Angular 2 Master Class

This is the Angular 2 Master Class exercise repository. Here's where you'll build your Angular application throughout this training.

If not done already, clone this repository using:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thoughtram/angular2-master-class-starter.git
```

Done? Great, now install the dependencies (this might take a little while):
```
$ cd angular2-master-class-starter
$ npm install
```

Then run the application by executing:

```
$ ng serve
```

Then open up your browser at `http://localhost:4200`

Have fun and good luck!
